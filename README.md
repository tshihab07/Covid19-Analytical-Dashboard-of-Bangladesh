## Overview

This repository contains an analytical dashboard built using Power BI to visualize and analyze COVID-19 data across different divisions in Bangladesh. The dashboard provides insights into confirmed cases, deaths, survival rates, and other key metrics over time.


## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. To get data used in this project, click [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/covid19-cases-in-bangladesh-dataset). This dataset contains COVID-19 cases of all the divisions in Bangladesh from 1st March 2020 to 2nd July 2021.

### Dataset Description
| Column Name                 | Description                             |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Date                        | Record date (daily granularity)         |
| Division                    | Name of the administrative division     |
| Confirmed Cases             | Total confirmed cases per day/division  |
| Deaths                      | Total reported deaths per day/division  |
| Case Rate                   | Cases per 100,000 population (estimated)|
| Death Rate                  | Deaths per 100,000 population (estimated)|

All values are **cleaned**, **normalized**, and **processed**. Missing values were handled using `interpolation` and `forward fill` due to skewed time series.


## Key Features

### Filters & Slicers

Here are the most useful visuals included in the final dashboard:

1. **Time-Series Analysis**
    - Line chart showing trends over time for confirmed cases vs deaths and confirmed cases vs survival.
    - Filterable by metric selector.

2. **Division-wise Comparison**
    - Clustered bar charts comparing total confirmed cases vs Survival
    - Impact table showing confirmed cases, deaths, survival rate, case rate, and death rate for each division.

4. **Distribution Charts**
    - Donut chart displaying the overall survival rate and death rate across Bangladesh
    - Bar chart displaying total confirmed cases for each division

5. **Summary Metrics**
    - Total confirmed cases
    - Total deaths
    - Total Survival

6. **Interactive Filters**
    - Division selector to filter visuals dynamically.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Cleaning & Processing
Before importing the data into Power BI, it underwent several important preprocessing steps in Python:

1. Date Formatting
    - The `Date` column was parsed correctly using `pd.to_datetime()` with a custom format.
    - Missing or inconsistent dates were coerced to `NaT` and corrected if possible.
2. Data Type Handling
    - All numeric columns were converted to numeric types using pd.to_numeric().
    - Non-numeric values were set to `NaN` and later handled appropriately.
3. Column Renaming & Division List
    - Standardized column names for consistency.
    - Defined list of divisions: `Barisal`, `Chittagong`, `Dhaka`, `Khulna`, `Mymensingh`, `Rajshahi`, `Rangpur`, `Sylhet`.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Histograms**: To analyze distributions
- **Boxplots**: To detect outliers
- **Scatter Plots**: To explore correlations between case rate and death rate

### 3. Missing Value Handling
Handling missing values was done carefully based on the type of metric:

1. Confirmed Cases & Deaths
    - These represent real-world events ‚Äî missing values likely mean no activity .
    - Therefore, all missing values in these columns were filled with 0.

2. Rate Columns (Case Rate, Death Rate)
    - Rates should only be calculated when there are confirmed cases or deaths.
    - We interpolated rate values only where confirmed cases > 0, to avoid introducing false trends.
    - Remaining missing values (e.g., at the start/end of the time series) were filled using forward/backward fill.

This ensures:
- No artificial rates appear where no cases existed
- Smooth trends where data was sparse but active

### 4. Outliers Treatment
Outliers can distort visualizations and analysis. To handle them effectively:
We applied a **`rolling window approach`** to detect and cap extreme values dynamically, where each division‚Äôs confirmed cases and deaths were processed separately.

This helps:
 - Reduce noise while preserving actual surges
 - Prevent false peaks from distorting visualizations

### 5. Feature Engineering
- `Total Survival` = `Confirmed Cases` - `Deaths`
- `Survival Rate` = `(Total Survival / Confirmed Cases) * 100`
- `Death Rate` = `(Deaths / Confirmed Cases) * 100`

3. Explore the Dashboard
    - Use the interactive visuals to explore trends and patterns in COVID-19 data across different divisions.
    - Apply filters (e.g., date range, division) to focus on specific regions or time periods.

4. Reproduce Data Cleaning Steps (Optional)
    - If you want to reproduce the data cleaning process:

5. Load covid_dataset.csv into Python.
    - Follow the preprocessing steps outlined in the data_preprocessing.ipynb notebook (if available).
